**Reports for U**

This is an edtech app with the purpose of helping teens store their grades over the semesters and years so they can keep track of their progress. It also removes the hassle of having to keep/maintain either pictures or physical copies.

First, you have to register and login.

Afterwords, you enter the home page where you can create new report cards

on clicking the report card, you can enter its page, after that click on plus icon in bottom right corner to add a subject, after which you can specify grade and marks. After you are done, click on save in the bottom and you can click on home in top left to go back to home. You can also click on logout to exit account.

To view again, just login and all you cards will be saved.

I made this as I had lost my report cards twice and I actively use this to keep track of my grades.
